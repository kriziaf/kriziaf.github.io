# The Nine Dot Test: the origin of the phrase "out of the box"

In my attempt to design geometric patterns using p5, I wanted to lay the foundation for future projects and thought of a brain teaser. I've just recently discovered this brain teaser this summer. It was a tough nut to crack!

I ended up using the ff method:

ellipse
line
strokeweight
Here's the premise of the game:

Nine dots arranged in a set of three rows. Your challenge is to draw four straight lines which go through the middle of all of the dots without taking the pencil off the paper. (In this case, your mouse cursor off the screen!)

Answer Hint: The Nine Dot Test is where the phrase "out of the box" originated.
